Supported Platforms
===================

The following operating systems and versions are supported by the OpenStack cookbooks:

* RHEL / CentOS 7
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

The cookbooks are tested and verified to work on the Chef stable track using
the `Chef Development Kit <https://docs.chef.io/about_chefdk.html>`_.

Your success rate may vary with the bleeding edge. Chef 12 and older is NOT
supported.

See `Chef CI <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-chef/latest/contributor/ci.html>`_
to see what is currently tested.
