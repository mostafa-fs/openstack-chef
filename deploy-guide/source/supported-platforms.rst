Supported Platforms
===================

The following operating systems and versions are supported by the OpenStack cookbooks:

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

The cookbooks are tested and verified to work on the Chef stable track using
the `Chef Development Kit <https://docs.chef.io/about_chefdk.html>`_.

Support for RHEL / CentOS 7 is mostly still present, but currently not maintained or
tested. Contributions are welcome.

Your success rate may vary with the bleeding edge. Chef 12 and older is NOT
supported.

Have a look at
`OpenStack Chef Continuous Integration <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-chef/latest/contributor/ci.html>`_
to see what is currently tested.
